## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Pictured below are the summary statistics of the multiple linear regression.

[Linear_Regression_Summary]

- Vehicle length and ground clearance both provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.

_- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?_

_- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?_


## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

Overall, the MechaCar suspension coils' variance meets requirements by being less than 100 pounds per square inch.

However, when evaluating the suspension coil data at the lot level, it is clear that Lot3 exhibits variance far in excess of acceptable metrics.
