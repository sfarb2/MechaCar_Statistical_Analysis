## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Pictured below are the summary statistics of the multiple linear regression.



- Vehicle length and ground clearance both provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.

- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
